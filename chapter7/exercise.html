	<h1> <u>BLACKSTONE BISTRO GALLERY</u></h1>
	<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorire shots here.</p>
	<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="bread.html"> <img src="./finishedexercise/gallery/thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"/> </a> <br> We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter.
	</p>
	<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
